Cornell University 2014, Computer Science B.A. Software Engineering specialization.

I currently work as a software developer over at the [Computational Physiology Lab @ Cornell](http://cplab.net/people/pedro-rittner-programmer/).

I like Python, C, C++, Java, OCaml.

I'd like to learn more Haskell, Rust, and Ruby.

I'm not really a web developer. Systems is more my thing.
