First post using Jekyll.

One thing that I noticed is that there was no recommendation for any particular
Ruby version manager (e.g. rvm) for use with the local Jekyll repository. This
isn't really nit-picking; `gem install github-pages` isn't a trivial process
(especially considering that you need a working JS runtime (I chose node.js)).

Other than having to putz around with rvm on my system, though, this works pretty well.

I do like the fact that the Jekyll pages look very clean, and I like working with markup.

I guess the next thing to do is get org-jekyll working in Emacs.
